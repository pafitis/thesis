Analysis by LaingBussion suggests that increased costs incurred by independent sector providers in England included the purchase of PPE, additional staffing and extensive deep cleaning. They estimate that, up to September 2020, around £3.3 billion of these additional cost pressures were funded by local government.',\n",
       " 'COVID-19 is likely to have a substantial impact on spending on existing healthcare services. The number of elective treatments and A&E visits have fallen in 2020. While lower levels of activity suggest lower expenditure, increases in the costs of providing those services is likely to partly offset this. Other services have been provided in alternative ways in 2020. A greater proportion of GP and specialist consultations were delivered as video or phone consultations in 2020 than in 2019. The cost of providing services in these forms may differ from typical face-to-face consultations.',\n",

The NHS Test and Trace budget for the financial year ending (FYE) 2021 was £22 billion. Early estimates suggest spending up to the end of October 2020 was much lower, at around £4 billion, although expenditure in 2021 is expected to be higher.',\n",
       " \"Current healthcare expenditure also covers the cost of administering vaccines. The UK's first COVID-19 vaccinations were administered on 8 December 2020. Around £5 billion was budgeted to support the procurement and deployment of vaccines in FYE 2021. Up to the 11th January, roughly 2.3 million individuals in the UK had received their first dose of vaccination, rising to over 31 million by the end of March 2021. This suggests that there will be some vaccination costs contributing to healthcare spending in 2020, although most vaccine deployment will be occurring from 2021.\",\n",

In next year's publication we will be able to draw upon more comprehensive sources of expenditure data to provide further analysis on the components driving the increase in healthcare spending.

The variation in growth rates is partly a result of the different type of healthcare services available through different schemes.',\n",

Healthcare expenditure represented 12.8% of GDP in 2020, up from 10.2% in 2019. This large increase was partly a result of very strong growth in healthcare expenditure but also partly due to a contraction in GDP, with the coronavirus pandemic having a major impact on both the healthcare sector and the wider economy.',\n",

It also covers expenditure on new services established to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including testing and tracing activities and the initial deployment of the COVID-19 vaccination programme. The estimate only covers the deployment of vaccines in 2020 and excludes the procurement of vaccines for deployment in future years. Our estimates are based on provisional financial data and as such will be subject to revision when the final accounting position of government departments for the year has been established.',\n",
       " 'Our estimates are based on provisional expenditure data, but an alternative source would be healthcare budgets, which show planned spending over the course of the year. Healthcare budgets for the financial year ending 2021 were significantly increased in response to the pandemic. If we used departmental supplementary supply estimates (PDF, 7.53MB), we might expect government healthcare spending to grow to approximately £230 billion for the calendar year 2020. However, departmental budgets, such as for the Department of Health and Social Care, are an upper limit, therefore actual expenditure may be lower. Early analysis suggests that central government expenditure is expected to be considerably lower than anticipated in recent official forecasts, which included an expected underspend on these budgetary limits.',\n",
       " 'Our initial estimates suggest that government healthcare spending in 2020 was in the region of £220 billion, accounting for over four-fifths (82%) of total healthcare expenditure. We estimate that government-financed healthcare spending rose by around 25% in 2020, by far the biggest year-on-year increase since our series began in 1997.',\n",

Initial data suggests that the coronavirus pandemic has had a far greater negative impact on GDP. This, combined with the increase to healthcare expenditure, results in a 2.6 percentage point increase in the share of GDP attributed to healthcare spending in 2020 compared with 2019.',\n",

Our estimates show an increase in NPISH expenditure, however, these are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.',\n",

Private hospital providers were commissioned by government to help support public health services during the height of the pandemic.

       " 'The largest indirect costs of the pandemic to existing healthcare services are likely to be greater staffing requirements and the increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by frontline healthcare workers. Spending on PPE by the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) in England was estimated at around £10 billion as of October 20201. Early financial data presented up to January 2021 suggests NHS providers in England incurred an additional £2.1 billion in pay costs over this period than was initially expected.',\n",
       " 'The share of GDP attributed to healthcare rose to around 12.8% in 2020, from 10.2% in 2019.',\n",
       " 'There are currently limited data available regarding out-of-pocket spending on long-term care services. The number of self-funding private clients is likely to have fallen in 2020, with this implying reduced expenditure, but this may have been offset by additional cost pressures on independent sector providers being passed onto self-funding clients. Regarding local authority arranged services, many local authorities in England expect to see income from client contributions to care fall below what was budgeted for in 2020.',\n",
       " 'There are currently no available data sources indicating the cost of treating patients with COVID-19. However, NHS England data indicates that COVID-19 patients represented a substantial share of occupied beds between April to December 2020, suggesting COVID-19 treatment is likely to account for a significant share of curative and rehabilitative care spending in 2020.',\n",

The latest analysis of healthcare expenditure by healthcare function and provider is available in our full health accounts for 2019. While our 2020 estimates include health-related long-term care, we are unable to provide estimates for total long-term care expenditure.',\n",
       " 'Total current healthcare expenditure in 2020 is estimated at £269 billion, a nominal-terms increase of 20% on spending in 2019.',\n",
       " 'Total healthcare expenditure grew by 20% in nominal terms between 2019 and 2020. This was by far the fastest year-on-year rate of growth in healthcare expenditure observed across the time series, which began in 1997.',\n",
       " 'We can observe different trends in household spending on healthcare in 2020 based on early estimates of household final consumption expenditure. Household spending on medical goods increased in 2020, while spending on medical services in both hospital and outpatient settings fell.',\n",
