       " 'Of the 1,775 staff who tested negative for antibodies in Round 2 and also tested in Round 4, 158 staff seroconverted from negative to positive. Taking into account the time period between the testing rounds, this gives a seroconversion rate of 5.9 per 1,000 person-weeks (95% confidence interval: 5.0 to 6.9).',\n",

In Round 4 of testing, 11,033 pupils (3,762 primary and 7,271 secondary) participated in at least one current COVID-19 infection or COVID-19 antibody test. The estimated response rate for secondary school pupils, in the year groups that participation was offered to, was 17%. The estimated response rate for primary school pupils was 20%. Details of previous rounds response rates can be found in the accompanying dataset.',\n",

       " 'The point estimate for the percentage testing positive increased in all local authorities between Rounds 2 and 4. Staff in Norfolk and Bournemouth (both local authorities with some of the lowest levels of COVID-19 infection in the community over the course of the pandemic), have statistically significantly lower rates of antibodies in Round 4 compared with staff in Liverpool, Lancashire, and Barking and Dagenham (areas where prevalence has been high at certain points during the course of the pandemic).',\n",

       " 'The seroconversion rates for pupils are higher than those seen for staff during the same time period. However, caution should be taken when comparing staff and pupils as the method of sampling and testing platform for antibodies differed. The oral fluid test was used to test for antibodies in pupils as it is non-invasive, however, it does have a lower sensitivity than the finger prick blood test used for staff.',\n",

       " 'To account for the different follow-up times between the rounds (on average the follow-up time between Rounds 1 and 2 was three weeks and between Rounds 2 and 4 was 15 weeks), the seroconversion rate has been calculated and expressed per 1,000 person-weeks. More details on this methodology are available. These seroconversion figures do not control for other factors that may affect the probability of seroconverting, for example, different distributions between local authorities of those sampled and different age distributions.',\n",
